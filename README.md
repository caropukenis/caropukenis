### Hello! My name is Caroline Pukenis

<!--
**caropukenis/caropukenis** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am currently a student in a fullstack development bootcamp through the University of Minnesota, my alma mater. I have an bachelor's degree in Entrepreneurial Design, a design I created to combine my passions of graphic design and business. I have gone back to school to learn more, and to make me a stronger web developer. 

Here are some fun things about me:
- I have two cats: Stormy and Poppy. 
- I knit, crochet, and sew.
- Animal crossing is one of my favorite games, and has been since 2006.
- Two travel destinations on my bucket list are the Hija Sophia and the Pyramids.
  - Though there are millions of other places I would love to see. 
  
Here are some career highlights for me:
- Planning events that helped raise hundreds of dollars for animal rescues.
- Being in management positions for 7 of the 10 years I have been working.
- Having two of my managers tell me that hiring me was one of the best choices they'd made. 
- Getting to make a pizza with the image of a Dalek on it (mostly pepperonis and olives).
  - It made their 8 year olds son's birthday even better.
